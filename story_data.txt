         "story":"Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, \u201cWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!\u201dWhen the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces. \u201cDon\u2019t scream wolf, boy,\u201d warned the villagers, \u201cwhen there is no wolf!\u201d They angrily went back down the hill. Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, \u201cWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!\u201d To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away. As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, \u201cSave your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don\u2019t cry \u2018wolf\u2019 when there is no wolf!\u201d But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more. Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, \u201cWolf! Wolf!\u201d But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn\u2019t come to help. At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn\u2019t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping. \u201cThere really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, \u2018Wolf!\u2019 but you didn\u2019t come,\u201d he wailed. An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, \u201cNobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!\u201d\n",

         "story":"There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine. For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus\u2019 efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed. Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold. But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn\u2019t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand. Hungry, Midas groaned, \u201cI\u2019ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!\u201dSeeing his dismay, Midas\u2019 beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. \u201cThe golden touch is no blessing,\u201d Midas cried. \n",

They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten. To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again. He tried a few more times but kept failing.

Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks. One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color. Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer, as friends. \n",

That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk and eggs and get more money!\u201dShe continued, \u201cWith more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other milkmaids jealous. \u201d Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly. Drenched, Molly said to herself, \u201cOh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now. \u201d She went home with her empty pails. \u201cOh, my goodness! What happened to you?\u201d Molly\u2019s mother asked. \u201cI was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails,\u201d she answered. \u201cOh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, \u2018Don\u2019t count your chickens until they hatch?\u2019\u201d\n",

As the days went on, he spoke less but heard more. The old owl heard people talking and telling stories. He heard a woman saying an elephant jumped over a fence.

Why can\u2019t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?\u201d The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed. Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood. The farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource. As the days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. How jinxed and how foolish they were. \n",

He has no right to draw water from the well. \u201dBirbal said, \u201cLook, since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in the farmer\u2019s well.

After 10 minutes, he asked Asha to peel the egg, peel the potato, and strain the leaves. Asha was left confused. Her father explained, \u201cEach item was placed into the same circumstance, boiling water. See how each responded differently?\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe egg was soft, but is now hard. The potato was hard, but is now soft. And the tea leaves, they changed the water itself. \u201dThe father then asked, \u201cWhen adversity calls, we respond in the same manner as they have.

The older brother took all the food and snatched all the good clothes. The oldest brother used to go into the forest in search of firewood to sell in the market. As he walked through the forest, he chopped off the branches of every tree, until he came upon a magical tree. The tree stopped him before he chopped its branches and said, \u2018Oh, kind sir, please spare my branches. If you spare me, I will provide you with golden apples. \u2019The oldest brother agreed but was feeling disappointed with how many apples the tree gave him. Overcome by greed, the brother threatened to cut the entire tree if it didn\u2019t provide him with more apples. But, instead of giving more apples, the tree showered him with hundreds of tiny needles. The brother fell to the ground, crying in pain as the sun began to set. Soon, the younger brother became worried and went to search for his older brother. He searched until he found him at the trunk of the tree, lying in pain with hundreds of needles on his body. He rushed to him and started to painstakingly remove each needle with love. Once the needles were out, the oldest brother apologized for treating his younger brother so badly. The magical tree saw the change in the older brother\u2019s heart and gifted them with all the golden apples they could need. \n",

         "story":"Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived in a village with his three sons. Although his three sons were hard workers, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried to unite them but failed. Months passed by, and the old man became sick. He asked his sons to remain united, but they failed to listen to him. At that moment, the old man decided to teach them a lesson \u2014 to forget their differences and come together in unity. The old man summoned his sons, then proceeded to tell them, \u201cI will provide you with a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick, and then break each into two. The one who finishes first will be rewarded more than the others. \u201dAnd so, the sons agreed. The old man provided them with a bundle of ten sticks each, and then asked the sons to break each stick into pieces. The sons broke the sticks within minutes, then proceeded to quarrel among themselves again. The old man said, \u201cMy dear sons, the game is not yet over. I will now give you another bundle of sticks. Only this time, you will have to break them together as a bundle, not separately. \u201dThe sons readily agreed and then tried to break the bundle. Despite trying their best, they could not break the sticks. The sons told their father of their failure. The old man said, \u201cMy dear sons, see! Breaking every single stick individually was easy for you, but breaking them in a bundle, you could not do. By staying united, nobody can harm you. If you continue to quarrel, then anyone can quickly defeat you. \u201dThe old man continued, \u201cI ask that you stay united. \u201d Then, the three sons understood there\u2019s power in unity, and promised their father they would all stay together. \n",

So, they promised to remain close to each other in case of any danger. All of a sudden, a big bear was approaching them. One of the friends quickly climbed a nearby tree, leaving the other friend behind. The other friend did not know how to climb, and instead, followed common sense. He laid down on the ground and remained there, breathless, pretending to be dead. The bear approached the friend lying on the ground. The animal started to smell his ear before slowly wandering off again because bears never touch those who are dead. Soon, the friend who hid in the tree came down. He asked his friend, \u201cMy dear friend, what secret did the bear whisper to you?\u201d The friend replied, \u201cThe bear simply advised me never to believe a false friend. \u201d\n",

Every night, before he went to bed, the miser went out into his garden to count his coins. He continued the same routine every day, but he never spent a single, golden coin. One day, a thief saw the old miser hiding his coins. Once the old miser went back into his house, the thief went to the hiding place and took all the gold. The following day, as the old man came out to count his coins, he found it was gone and started wailing loudly. His neighbor heard the cries and came running, asking what had happened. Upon learning what had occurred, the neighbor asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just save the money inside your house where it would\u2019ve been safe?\u201dThe neighbor continued, \u201cHaving it inside the house would make it easier to access when you need to buy something. \u201d \u201cBuy something?\u201d answered the miser, \u201cI was never going to spend my gold. \u201dWhen hearing this, the neighbor picked up a stone and threw it.

         "story":"A mother dog and her pups lived on a farm. On the farm, there was a well. The mother dog always told her pups never to go near or play around it. One day, one of the pups was overcome by curiosity and wondered why they weren\u2019t allowed to go near the well. So, he decided he wanted to explore it. He went down to the well and climbed up the wall to peek inside. In the well, he saw his reflection in the water but thought it was another dog. The little pup got angry when his reflection was imitating him, so he decided to fight it. The little pup jumped into the well, only to find there was no dog. He began to bark and bark until the farmer came to rescue him. The pup had learned his lesson and never went back to the well again. \n",

One day, his father gifted him a hammer and a bundle of nails, then said, \u201cWhenever you get mad, hammer a nail into the backyard fence. \u201dIn the first days, the boy used up half of the nails. Over the next weeks, he used up fewer nails, until his temper was under control. Then, his father asked the young boy to remove a nail for each day he didn\u2019t lose his temper. On the day when the boy removed his last nail, his father told him, \u201cYou have done good, boy. But, can you see the holes in the wall? The fence is never going to be the same. Likewise, when you say mean things in anger, you\u2019ll leave a scar. \u201d\n",
